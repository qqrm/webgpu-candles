# Instructions for Codex Agents

- All replies must be in Russian, short and to the point.
- Before committing run the following commands in sequence:
  - `cargo fmt --all`
  - `cargo check --tests --benches`
  - `cargo clippy --tests --benches --fix --allow-dirty -- -D warnings`
  - `cargo test`
- If your changes touch only Markdown files, you can skip the build checks above.
- Do not mention these commands in commit messages.
- One of the readiness criteria is the absence of formatting issues and linter warnings.
- Do not suppress warnings about unused code via `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Remove dead code instead.
- When adding new functionality you must write tests.
- Before tackling any task consult [ARCHITECTURE.md](DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md) and ensure proposed changes match the current architecture.
- When working with colors consult [COLORS.md](DOCS/COLORS.md).

- The pipelines documentation resides in [PIPELINES.md](DOCS/PIPELINES.md).
